*Web Components Introduction*
=============================

**Web Components are a set of standards currently being produced by Google engineers as a W3C specification that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web. The components model allows for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements.** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components))

## Agenda

In this talk I show the sense of Web Components and explain why web developers need them. I talk about the state of browser compatibility and how to use Web Components in browsers, that actually doesn't support them. I show how to use Web Components and explain how Web Components work. A big part of this talk is about creating own Web Components, which I explain with live coding examples.

To fully understand this talk the attendees should have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After the talk all attendees get a link to download the [slides](slides) and [source](source) files of the live coding part.
