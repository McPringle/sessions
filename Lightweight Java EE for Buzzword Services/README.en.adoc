= Lightweight Java EE for Buzzword Services
Marcus Fihlon, https://www.fihlon.ch/

Java EE is not a hype. It is a well known player since 1999 â€“ a quite long time but Java EE is just about to come off age.

"Modern" developers create buzzword services, they use "state of the art" and "lightweight" frameworks. But when is a service "micro"? When is a framework lightweight? How does Java EE fit in this modern world of software development?

Java EE is a perfect choice for writing micro services. In this talk I try to prove my statement. Live on stage I write two services with RESTful JSON APIs with only a few lines of code which communicate with each other and run the services using a local Docker cloud where you can see how these services can be scaled up and down to manage fluctuating loads. Coding, building, deploying, scaling: fast and efficient!

This talk is code driven with a lot of live coding. No hyping. No bashing. Just fast and efficient coding. It has been approved for open audiences only. Hypersensitivity to occasional profanity requires covering ears and eyes.
