= Java 8 Date and Time API
Marcus Fihlon, https://www.fihlon.ch/

The JSR-310 provides a new and advanced API to handle date and time values based on the experience with the two old APIs (Date and Calendar). In this talk I illustrate this new API in a quick overview and show you how easy this new API is to use. In a live coding session I show the new entities for date and time values and the new way how to modify and how to calculate with them.

To fully understand this talk the attendees should have basic knowledge of Java. After the talk all attendees get a link to download the slides and source files of the live coding part.
